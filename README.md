# synapse-helm
A helm chart to deploy synapse server for matrix.org

**PLEASE NOTE** This chart is in still in development. It is still very much coupled to my kubernetes cluster setup and as such should not be considered a universal installer for getting synapse installed onto a kubernetes cluster
